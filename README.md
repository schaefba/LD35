# LD35-Sudden-Shift
This is a small game we built in the 72-hour Ludum Dare game jam. 

## Game Description
You're suddenly plagued with the spirit of the devil. This causes you to randomly shapeshift into a hideous demon, which sure makes it hard to go about your daily life. 

In this top-down, stealth-like game, avoid getting detected when you shift shape and make your way to work before you're late. People around you won't be bothered if you look like a human, but they will certainly call the police if you look like a gangly demon!
